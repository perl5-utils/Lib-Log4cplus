=head1 NAME

Lib::Log4cplus - Perl interface to log via Log4cplus

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Lib::Log4cplus;

  my $logger = Lib::Log4cplus->new(config_file => "/path/to/config.properties");
  $logger->log_info("main", "Lib::Log4cplus works great!");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 INTERFACE

Lib::Log4cplus has some low-level XS functions (which are not exported)
and a few methods suitable for class.

=cut

XSLoader::load("Lib::Log4cplus", "$VERSION");

=head1 FUNCTIONS

All these functions are provided by the XS API to log4cplus.
Nothing is exported by default and it's not recommended to use any
of the functions directly.

=head2 basic_configure

  basic_configure(logToStdErr);

Enables a builtin basic configuration:

  rootLogger=DEBUG, STDOUT
  appender.STDOUT=log4cplus::ConsoleAppender
  appender.STDOUT.logToStdErr=0

Any currently existing configuration is not reset.

The parameter logToStdErr is ignored at the moment and will passed
at a later release of log4cplus.

See L<http://log4cplus.sourceforge.net/docs/html/classlog4cplus_1_1BasicConfigurator.html> for more details.

=head2 file_configure

  file_configure("/path/to/logger.properties");

Enables a configuration which is stored in a file.

Any currently existing configuration is not reset.

See L<http://log4cplus.sourceforge.net/docs/html/classlog4cplus_1_1PropertyConfigurator.html> for more details.

=head2 static_configure

  my $properties = <<EOP;
  rootLogger=DEBUG, STDOUT
  appender.STDOUT=log4cplus::ConsoleAppender
  appender.STDOUT.logToStdErr=0
  EOP

  static_configure($properties);

Enables a configuration which is given by a list of properties
separated by newlines.

Any currently existing configuration is not reset.

See L<http://log4cplus.sourceforge.net/docs/html/classlog4cplus_1_1PropertyConfigurator.html> for more details.

=head2 logger_exists

  say "Yes" if logger_exists("wuff");
  say "Always" if logger_exists(undef);

Tells whether the specified logger exists. The rootLogger does
always exists, even if it might not be configured.

=head2 logger_is_enabled_for

  say "Noisy" if logger_is_enabled_for(undef, 10000); # DEBUG_LOG_LEVEL
  say "Oops" unless logger_is_enabled_for("security", 30000); # WARN_LOG_LEVEL

Tells whether the specified logger will log the requested log-level. The
log-level has to be specified as an integer constant as described in the
API documentation of log4cplus. The C<constant> routine allows to fetch
a bunch of log-level values predefined during configuration process.

See L<http://log4cplus.sourceforge.net/docs/html/clogger_8h.html> for
more details.

=head2 logger_log

  logger_log("access", 20000, $resource->path . " 200 OK") == 0 or die "Logger broken";

Takes a message (one string - not more, not formats) and pass it to the
assigned appenders, if log-level is turned on for the logger.

=head2 logger_force_log

  logger_force_log("access", 20000, $resource->path . " 200 OK") == 0 or die "Logger broken";

Takes a message (one string - not more, not formats) and pass it to the
assigned appenders, regardless whether log-level is turned on for the
logger or not.
